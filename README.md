# Closest-Neighbor

A PyQT5 GUI application designed to work with SQL Latitude-Longitude data, by utilizing distance formulas such as the Vincenty Formula. 

At the moment, the algorithms I've been working on do one of the following: 
- Find the *n* closest points to a given point in the table
- Find all points within a given radius *r* around a specific point from the table
